1. Main Function

-- Use if __name__ == '__main__': to make code executable only when run directly (not when imported)
-- Serves as the program entry point

-- open() - Open files (use with for auto-closing)
-- Modes: 'r' (read), 'w' (write), 'a' (append), 'b' (binary)

Example:
  with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

-- Example: math.py is a built-in module for mathematical operations.
